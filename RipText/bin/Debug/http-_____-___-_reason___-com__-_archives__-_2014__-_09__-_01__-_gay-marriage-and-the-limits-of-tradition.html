Perhaps the low point for their side came when one was asked why Wisconsin makes it so hard for same-sex couples to adopt and ventured to say, "I think tradition is one of the reasons."</p> <p>At that, Judge Richard Posner did not slap his forehead and exclaim, "Of course! Why didn't we see that? Everything makes sense now!" Instead, he retorted: "How can tradition be a reason for anything?"</p> <p>Many states, he noted, had a hallowed tradition of forbidding interracial marriage until 1967, when the Supreme Court said they couldn't. Posner couldn't see how entrenched practice, no matter how ancient, mattered in that case or this one. The argument, he said, amounted to: "We've been doing this stupid thing for a hundred years, a thousand years. We'll keep doing it because it's tradition."</p> <p>His rebuff betrays a fatal problem for opponents of same-sex marriage. One of their central arguments is that we should limit marriage to male-female couples because that's been the norm in Western cultures for millennia. It's an argument deeply rooted in conservative political philosophy. But conservative political philosophy has never really had much influence in the United States, even among those who call themselves conservative.</p> <p>In his 1953 book "The Conservative Mind," Russell Kirk expounded a view peculiar to the right. "Even the most intelligent of men cannot hope to understand all the secrets of traditional morals and social arrangements," he wrote, "but we may be sure that Providence, acting through the medium of human trial and error, has developed every hoary habit for some important purpose." It's not an argument often heard in our debates.</p> <p>Americans do pay homage to our past by invoking the Declaration of Independence, the framers, the Constitution, Abraham Lincoln, and so on. But the idea that we should be afraid to make changes in our laws for fear of rending the organic fabric of society doesn't command much allegiance on either the left or the right.</p> <p>Liberals have never made a fetish of obeisance to the past. They agree with the revolutionary pamphleteer Thomas Paine that giving primacy to tradition unjustly places "the authority of the dead over the rights and freedom of the living."</p> <p>American conservatives largely share that premise. The New Deal has been in place for some 80 years, but conservatives don't believe in conserving <em>that</em>. Their feeling is it was a bad idea then, and it's a bad idea now.</p> <p>None of this means Americans have no use for traditions. We have all sorts of favorites, from fireworks on the Fourth of July to football in autumn. But we feel entitled to alter and embellish them at our whim. The fireworks we see are bigger and better than the ones Americans saw a century ago. Football now starts in August and goes till February.</p> <p>Marriage morphed repeatedly long before gays got it. Women acquired more rights, divorce became available to anyone who wanted it, and alimony grew less common. People of different races can now marry each other even in places where it was once cause for lynching.</p> <p>Longstanding arrangements that make sense endure without controversy, and that's just the point: They make sense. Tradition and a good reason will win an argument, just as tradition and $2 will get you a ride on the bus. Americans don't keep doing things unless they serve our purposes, even if they suited our grandparents to a T.</p> <p>The 20th-century Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. spoke for most of us: "It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past."</p> <p>The prevailing ethos in this country is that we are the masters of tradition, not the servants. We treasure the customs and practices passed down from our ancestors. And we change them anytime we want.</p> </div> </div>  <footer> <p><p>Steve Chapman is a columnist and editorial writer for the Chicago Tribune.</p></p> <p><a target="_blank">Media Contact</a> <a target="_blank">Reprint Requests</a></p> <div>  <ul> <li><a target="_blank">EMAIL</a></li> <li> <a target="_blank">SHARE</a> <ul> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Facebook</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Twitter</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Tumblr</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Blogger</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>StumbleUpon</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Digg</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank" _blank"=""><img>Delicious</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Reddit</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Google</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Linkedin</a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank"><img>Kindle</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li><a target="_blank">PRINT</a></li> </ul> </div>  </footer>  <aside>  </aside>      <div> <a target="_blank"></a> <div> <a>VIEW COMMENTS (192)</a> | <a target="_blank">LEAVE A COMMENT</a> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <p><strong>Editor's Note</strong>: We invite comments and request that they be civil and on-topic.

There are legal arguments against both that stand up better than arguments against regular gay marriage, though. For polygamy, the whole legal system regarding marriage is set up based on two partners. A 3rd (or more) partner adds complications that can't be easily remedied without major law changes. For example, how would the 3rd+ spouse be accounted for on a tax return, who would be the legal parents of a child born/adopted into the family, or how would property be divided if 1 spouse divorces the others. For family members, there are legally-recognized rights regarding parents and children (and to a lesser degree siblings and other relatives) -- parents can cover a child on their health insurance until the child is 26 years old, children can visit their parents in the hospital when visits are restricted to "family" only, and children can inherit property in many instances when there was no will in place. Gay marriage between two individuals fits more easily into the current legal structures, because the entire legal system surrounding marriage is based on the union of 2 adults who are not already 1st-degree relatives.</p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong>Notorious G.K.C.</strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 9:36AM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p>"For polygamy, the whole legal system regarding marriage is set up based on two partners."</p> <p>And it wasn't set up based on one of those partners being a man and another one being a woman?</p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong>Stoic</strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 10:00AM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p>Yes, but the difference is relatively minor in legal terms. There is the issue of presumption that children are biologically related to both parents, but laws regarding that aren't so clear-cut even with heterosexual marriage. In some states a husband is considered the legal father of his wife's child (if the child is born while they are married), regardless of direct evidence that he is indeed not the biological father.

There is a so-called communications privilege for spouses. Then there is the exemption to be a prosecution witness against a spouse in criminal cases (with some exceptions).

The logic of Windsor virtually compelled the US District Courts which had since heard the issue of state bans against gay marriage, and this is reflected in the fact that about 20 US District Courts have handed down a string of unbroken, consecutive victories in favor of marriage equality, holding that the Due Process and / or Equal Protection Clause[s] of the Fourteenth Amendment mandate[s] such an outcome in the light of Justice Kennedy's reasoning in Windsor (as well as his reasoning in Lawrence v.

Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973)); stated differently, the government has to demonstrate an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for the challenged measure (United States v.

If you are so concerned about marriage being "destroyed," try to do something about infidelity and divorce. Gay couples merely seek access to the institution which you take for granted because you already have it or do not need it; I have yet to hear a cogent analysis of how the recognition of gay marriages (which are now legal in 19 states) will have a deleterious impact on heterosexual marriages (I have heard the "simply because it will" argument many, many times before, so please try to come up with something original, rather than repeating a tautological and circular assertion divorced from any factual context which could grant it some measure of merit).</p> <p>Please explain this to me -- do you honestly believe that a significant number of heterosexual couples will decide not to get married now that gay marriage is taking hold incrementally but inexorably?

Remember Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), in which case SCOTUS opined as follows:</p> <p>"It is emphatically the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret the rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the Court must decide on the operation of each.</p> <p>If courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply."</p> <p>That is your answer.

How does permitting gay couples to marry bear upon the fidelity and integrity of straight marriages? It would be nice to receive an actual answer to this question instead of the "because it simply does" explanations which social conservatives have given, over and over again, like a mantra.</p> <p>Do you seriously believe that straight couples will choose not to marry once gay couples gain the right to marry? Nineteen states and the District of Columbia presently permit gay marriage, with just under 50% of the US population living within those states -- and straight couples in those 19 states are still getting married in the same numbers (ballpark figures) as was the case before gay marriage became legal in those 19 states.</p> <p>Do you believe that straight married couples in those 19 states will now get divorced in increased numbers because gay couples are now permitted to marry in those 19 states? The data show otherwise -- divorce rates have not soared as a function of gay marriage rates.</p> <p>I keep hearing the argument that gay marriage in some way degrades the institution of marriage, with no explanation ever given as to how this takes place, and no examples given as to how this takes place. Do you believe this?</p> <p>I hope to engage you in reasoned debate relative to this issue.</p> <p>PHILIP CHANDLER</p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong><a target="_blank">Thomas O.</a></strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 6:26PM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p>"Our birth rates are dropping, and soon enough we will be required to import immigrants to keep our tax base high so we can pay for all these welfare leeches."</p> <p>Remember when dropping birth rates were a good thing?

As late as the 1970s, married women lost their legal identities through a legal precept known as coverture. Under this legal doctrine, the woman's legal identity was subsumed under that of her husband. For legal purposes, she ceased to exist, and could not even enter into some contracts without the express permission of her husband.</p> <p>Prior to no fault divorce laws (which now exist in all 50 states), any married person seeking a divorce had to enter into an adversarial relationship with his or her spouse in a court of law, citing justifications such as irreconcilable differences, adultery, desertion, etc. This is no longer the case -- and although many conservatives decry this development as destructive of marriage, I have yet to hear them bray about this issue to the same extent and at the same volume as they bray about gay marriage (and about homosexuality more generally).</p> <p>CONTINUED...</p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong></strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 1:42PM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p>Quite simply, some persons are homosexual -- i.e., they form romantic, sexual, and emotional attachments to members of the same sex. Prior to the 1970s, gay persons were criminalized in every state in the nation (consensual "sodomy" was a felony in states such as Georgia). During the 1970s, some states repealed their "sodomy" statutes. The US Supreme Court enshrined contempt for gay men and lesbians into constitutional law in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986). Fortunately, a wise and more enlightened court explicitly overruled itself with respect to this issue, handing down Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003) (striking down all state "sodomy" statutes as applied to gay sex in private settings between consenting adults). The same Court struck down Colorado's notorious state constitutional amendment known as "Amendment 2," which permitted both private and public sector discrimination against homosexuals and robbed them of the right to petition their government, at all levels, for redress of grievances. Now, the Court has mandated that the US government grant to married gay couples all of the privileges, benefits, and protections granted to married heterosexual couples as a matter of course (United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 12 (2013). The logic of this decision has compelled 20 US District Courts to reach the same conclusion – which is that gay marriage is mandated by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p> <p>CONTINUED...</p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong>Winston</strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 1:43PM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p><em>the authority of the dead over the rights and freedom of the living</em></p> <p>Sorry but Pain was full of shit on that: <a target="_blank" href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girondin_constitutional_project'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.....al_project</a></p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong></strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 1:43PM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p>I cite from Lawrence, supra: "Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific.

Furthermore, other states will legalize gay marriage regardless of how SCOTUS rules once a gay marriage case arrives via a petition for certiorari. It is only a matter of time before gay marriages are recognized as genuine marriages and are accepted by the majority of the population (acceptance by the majority has already been reached, with 59% of the American people believing that gay couples should be able to marry (see the Washington Post / ABC News poll for more on this)).</p> <p>We will prevail, even if it takes us a few years (assuming that SCOTUS refuses to side with us on this issue, which is an assumption fraught with potential error of great magnitude given the lineup of the Court in Windsor).</p> <p>PHILIP CHANDLER</p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong>Tony</strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 6:12PM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p>Yeah that civil rights movement, what a bust right?</p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong>RussianPrimeMinister</strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 6:38PM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p><strong>SHUT THE FUCK UP</strong></p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong>Michael Ejercito</strong>|<strong><time>9.2.14 @ 12:09AM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p>Indiana equally bans black and white, Mormon and Protestant, homosexual and heterosexual from entering into a same-sex marriage.</p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong><a target="_blank">Cindy Gobrecht</a></strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 7:06PM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p><a target="_blank" href='http://cindybiondigobrecht.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/cant-buy-me-love/'> http://cindybiondigobrecht.wor.....y-me-love/</a></p> </div>  <div class='commentactions'>  <p><a target="_blank">log in</a> or <a target="_blank">register</a> to reply</p> </div> </li>  <li> <p><strong><a target="_blank">ErmaBBelcher</a></strong>|<strong><time>9.1.14 @ 8:46PM</time></strong>|<a target="_blank">#</a></p>  <div> <p>Start working at home with Google!
